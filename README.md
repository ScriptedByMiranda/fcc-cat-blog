# 🐱 FreeCodeCamp Cat Blog  

This is a FreeCodeCamp workshop project. It’s a simple blog page built with **HTML** to practice:  
- Headings, paragraphs, and lists  
- Links and images  
- Semantic tags like `<article>` and `<section>`  

## Reflection  
While this is a basic, guided project, it helped me get more comfortable with structuring HTML pages.  
If I revisit this later, I’d like to personalize it (maybe about my cat, Cinderella 🐾) and add CSS styling.
